# Project Ideas
A place to keep random project ideas so I don't have post-its everywhere.

## NOTE
Anyone who stumbles upon this and decides to develop any of these ideas, please just send me a link to the project.  I just want to see these built.

### Local JSFiddle
 * Use Electron to build a JSFiddle clone that is stand-alone without the need of the internet.
 * Incorporate tutorials to teach beginner web development

### Versioned markdown documentation 
  * Similar to [Flatdoc](http://ricostacruz.com/flatdoc/)
  * wiki like.  Maybe Git backed?
